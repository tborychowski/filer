# Filer
A File Manager for the Keyboard People.

#### Disclaimer
This is mac-first app. It should be cross-platform, because it's using Electron, but it's not, because I'm lazy and because I have no access to Windows & Linux machines to actually test it. If you do, and have lots of time to spare - I would welcome your help :smile:. Otherwise, please don't ask me for this.



# Screens
Should follow soon...
