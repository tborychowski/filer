# Filer
A File Manager for the Keyboard People.



# TODO

- core: new folder, new file
- open terminal here
- open finder here
- open any app (sublime) here...
- git: open repo here
- copy, cut & paste (visual & progress)

- core: cache folders, and bg sync
- core: settings (json?)
- bookmarks bar - store fav folders...
- breadcrumbs: make it nicer and clickable?

- cmd+p should focus search but trigger the path-finder mode (filter bookmarks)

- statusbar
    - async folder size?
